  "description": "Created by Australian technologist Luke Millanta, Disconnected is a one-of-one, dynamic, evolving NFT artwork that leverages United Nations datasets to track global internet connectivity rates. Disconnected will evolve over time, continuing to grow as more and more people are connected to the internet.\nAt the time of minting, 37% of the world’s population (approximately 3 billion people) had never used the internet. Disconnected has been created to raise awareness and encourage the world’s governments to do more in ensuring their citizens have access to a free and open internet.\n",
